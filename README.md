# Use of C++ Control Structures and Pattern Printing


## Project Objective

This project demonstrates the use of conditional statements, loops, and basic pattern generation using C++. It includes 10 well-structured programs that enhance understanding of:

- `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements  
- `for` and `while` loops  
- Nested loops for pattern printing  
- String and numeric logic for verification  
- Input/output formatting and control flow

## List of Programs

### 1. Simple For Loops

**Description:**  
Prints even numbers from 0 to 10 and then prints “SIT” five times.

**Output:**
```
0
2
4
6
8
10

SIT
SIT
SIT
SIT
SIT
```

**Description:**  
Displays a right-aligned triangle using stars.

**Output:**
```
        * 
      * * 
    * * * 
  * * * * 
* * * * * 
```

### 3. Left Aligned Star (*) Triangle

**Description:**  
Displays a left-aligned triangle using stars.

**Output:**
```
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
```

### 4. Inverted Star (*) Pyramid

**Description:**  
Displays an inverted centered pyramid of stars.

**Output:**
```
*********
 *******
  *****
   ***
    *
```

### 5. Inverted Left Aligned Star (*) Triangle

**Description:**  
Displays a left-aligned triangle of stars in descending order.

**Output:**
```
* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* * 
* 
```

### 6. Inverted Right Aligned Star (*) Triangle

**Description:**  
Displays a right-aligned triangle of stars in inverted form.

**Output:**
```
* * * * * 
  * * * * 
    * * * 
      * * 
        * 
```

### 7. Pyramid Star (*) Pattern

**Description:**  
Prints a centered pyramid of stars.

**Output:**
```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

### 8. Reversing Digits in a Number

**Description:**  
Takes a 4-digit number and prints it in reverse order.

**Sample Output:**
```
Enter the last four digits of your PRN number: 3029
Reversed digits: 9203
```

---

### 9. Floyd's Triangle

**Description:**  
Prints Floyd’s Triangle using increasing natural numbers row by row.

**Sample Output:**
```
Enter the number of rows for Floyd's Triangle: 5
1 
2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 10 
11 12 13 14 15 
```

---

### 10. Password Verification

**Description:**  
A secure password validation program that:
- Requires at least one capital letter, one number, and one special character.
- Prompts the user to re-enter the password for verification.

**Sample Output:**
```
Set password: 785@A
Password is set successfully.

Enter password: 785@A
System Unlocked
```

## Learning Outcomes

- Implemented control structures (`if`, `else`, `switch`)  
- Gained hands-on practice with nested loops and logic-based conditions  
- Understood how to build patterns and validate user inputs  
- Improved understanding of console-based input/output formatting
